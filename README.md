# SSAC_submission

This repository contains all the code relevant to our (the Smart Stadium Machine Learning Team at Georgia Tech) submission to the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2024. All code and data used in the creation of the Markov Chain is in the repository. The Data Pre-Processing notebook contains code transforming the video of static frames to feature vectors; The ModelFusion3 notebook contains code of the customized Recurrent Neural Network and the integration of the Markov Chain. The actual video data is not included in the repository due to the size of the dataset used but can be sent over through alternative mediums. However, the outputs of the Data Pre-Processing notebook are all stored in the outputs folder and they are used in the ModelFusion3 notebook. The outputs folder is missing a "resnet_cnn_images.npy" file as it was too large for Github and Git LFS, these file can also be sent over through alternative mediums if necessary.
