# SSAC_submission

This repository contains all the code relevant to our (the Smart Stadium Machine Learning Team at Georgia Tech) submission to the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 2024. All code and data used in the creation of the Markov Chain is in the repository. The Data Pre-Processing notebook contains code transforming the video of static frames to feature vectors; The ModelFusion3 notebook contains code of the customized Recurrent Neural Network and the integration of the Markov Chain. The actual video data is not included due to the size of the dataset used and the need to preserve Intellectual Property. Moreover, some file paths will need to be adjusted when running the code, and each relevant cell contains comments with further instructions.
